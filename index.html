        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>about us</kbd></h1>


        <p class="text-capitalize">Where would you see a child frown, yet be happy at the same time? Where would you find a student making healthy choices for lunch? Where would you see little hands writing out their own future?

            Presenting FKS, where children are schooled for life. The lessons they learn here, the experiences they pick up, the relationships they forge stay with them as they move on to bigger, wider, and more challenging arenas. Because FKS emphasizes the most important life lessons: to be independent, to be responsible, and above all, to dream the impossible dream. In turn, we consider it our duty to provide them the support and skills to achieve that dream.

            After all, the school did start as a dream, which turned into a happy reality. Shailaja Rao, the founder and Principal began FKS to graduate solid, world citizens. She started a school where kids could be kids, where parents and teachers were only instruments in helping children realize their full potential. In good times and bad, in tough times and easy, at work and play, students would be taught and then encouraged to seek and find solutions that they could own. Teachers and parents would only be the support network, not even ‘behind-the-scenes-doers’. FKS was, is and will always be the school that puts students first. And no one understands and appreciates that more than the students themselves. In their own words, with their own thoughts, read here what our students, past and present have to say about FKS.</p>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>


        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Our Background</kbd></h1>

        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize">FKS was founded in 1997, in Hyderabad by Shailaja Rao, with 20 students on a 4,000sft rented space with one teacher and five support staff. The school grew to 560 students, 65 teachers and 55 support staff in 2005, and today stands proud with over one thousand students on a three-acre facility comprising four buildings, a kitchen, and 16 school buses.

            The FKS philosophy of “child first” has stood us through some tough times, a simple fact that many educational institutions profess to follow, but few succeed. The Principal and the Board of Directors firmly believe that the success of the outgoing students and the satisfaction of the parents will further strengthen the FKS motto of “child-centric” education.

            Every step that Shailaja Rao and her Board take in ensuring that FKS students and their needs come first, result in each student feeling that he or she is the recipient of individual attention.

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>A Day At FKS</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>all aboard!</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize"> The day begins as the yellow FKS bus draws up to pick up the students at their homes. A designated Bhaiyya (as the fifty one drivers are addressed) and assistant help the kids into the buses and drop them off at school.

            An interesting and reassuring fact is that Shailaja Rao, the Principal, considers it part of her schedule to periodically to follow the school buses to determine the safest and fastest routes. </p>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Eat Healthy!</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize">Our students receive a well-planned, nourishing breakfast or snack to start their day. The kitchen is run by Mrs Leela Rao, an administrator, entrepreneur, and now a grandmother with the help of eleven Didis (elder sisters). The menu is designed with the idea that a growing child, a picky palette and, anxious parents are all to be taken very seriously.

            A well-balanced diet can also be tasty and “yummy”: proof of pudding that that Mrs. Rao presents on a daily basis. In fact, her tasters are student volunteers and she takes suggestions and cooking help from the 11th graders as she plans the daily menu!</p>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Together We Can!</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize">The children assemble for the day, as the Principal, Shailaja Rao and the members of the Student Council help kick start the day with prayers and announcements.

            The Assembly is held once a week in the vast grounds of the school, where the boulders that dot the grounds are not seen as obstacles, but rather used as props: a stage to stand on, sit on or play around.


        </p>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>To Live Is To Learn!</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize">Students file into their respective classrooms, where they turn explorers, scientists, humanitarians, historians, artists, speakers, singers and dancers. No stone left unturned, as teachers encourage, urge, and spur the children on reach their goals. Every child is treated as an individual, and every individual thought is acknowledged. All children are encouraged to participate in every activity: no child leaves the school wishing they’d been given that one chance to speak on stage or perform the funky dance they so wanted to. Our environment, ambience spawns that unique out of the box thinking that FKS is now renowned for.

            Recess is the time to take a snack, (have a snack) stretch the (their) legs and fool around a bit. The grounds are completely safe, with security guarding the entrance (all the crucial areas). Play equipment specially built with different age groups in mind, is located at different facilities – separate for the Kindergartners and smaller classes, and larger grounds for higher classes.</p>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Classes In Session!</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize">Classrooms are where the children are at work solving problems, digging for more questions, and deciphering tough world issues. Teachers assign projects that challenge the students to work at their pace, and encourage teamwork. Homework is discussed at length and teachers ensure that the students are confident of tackling it independently before they head home. Hence parental involvement is at best minimal, and for most part non-existent.

            At FKS teachers and students place a high premium on independence. Students are proud of their success, especially when they arrive at it on independent effort.</p>
        
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h1 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Tomorrow Is Another Day!</kbd></h1>
        
        <br><br><br>

        <p class="text-capitalize">The bell rings at 3:30 PM, signaling the end of another busy day at FKS. Students file out to get in their respective buses to head home. Most kids have to be forcibly hustled on to their buses, for it with utmost reluctance that they leave the school. Such is the love our students have for the school and staff!.</p>
